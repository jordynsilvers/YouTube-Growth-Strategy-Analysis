YouTube Channel Growth Strategy Analysis 

This project, developed using Python and Pandas, focuses on transforming raw data from the world's 1,000 most-subscribed YouTube channels into actionable Business Analytics insights.

Instead of building a prediction model, the goal is to define key performance indicators (KPIs) and use them to generate a strategic report on content efficiency and market niches for a media or content strategy team.

Project Goals
KPI Engineering: Create new metrics to measure content quality and channel longevity that go beyond simple subscriber count.

Strategic Analysis: Identify the most successful content categories based on median performance, rather than just mean performance (which is easily skewed by outliers).

Correlation Mapping: Quantify the relationship between channel age and content performance to inform long-term investment strategies.

Key Findings for Business Strategy
The analysis identified key strategic correlations critical for investment decisions:

Category Performance: Identified the top 10 categories based on a combination of Median Subscribers and Content Efficiency (Avg. Views per Video), revealing which niches, such as [Insert your top category here, e.g., Music or Entertainment], have the highest barrier to entry.

Content Efficiency: Channels demonstrated a

 correlation between longevity (age) and high average views per video. This suggests that sustained content quality improves with time and experience.

Strategic Gaps: The analysis revealed categories with high subscriber counts but low content efficiency, indicating potential business opportunities for content partners to optimize video output and viewer engagement.
